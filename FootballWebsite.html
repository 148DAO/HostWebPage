            The NFL or the National Football Leauge is a league if 32 teams that compete for the Championship. 
            It is divided by the AFC (American Football Conference) and the NFC (National Football Conference). 
            The NFL is actually not National for it only consists of American teams in different famous American citys or towns. 
            It is one of the most famous sports in America if not the most popular sports in America.
            Many people not just in America but worldwide come together becoming United to watch the epic Championship game each year!

            Like I said before the NFL is divided in to two conferences, the American Football Conference or the AFC, and the National Football Conference or the NFC.
             In the picture to the right you will see which teams are seperated by these two conferences such as my personal favorite team the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC.
             As you might know the Rams are fairly located in the mid-western area.
             There are 4 different areas that the NFC could be locate din NFC West, NFC East, NFC North, or NFC South.
             This is same for the AFC which also has these four sections except for the AFC.
