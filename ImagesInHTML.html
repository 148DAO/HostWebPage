        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a text-based <i>Programming</i> <mark>language</mark> used on the client and server side. Therefore it could then be used for 
        things like <em>web-development</em> and <del>making</del> allowing users to make the web page interact. Therefore 
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is not the style ("<dfn>CSS</dfn>") or the design ("<u>HTML</u>") but <big>more</big> of the input <strike>giving</strike> allowing web pages
        to have interactive <acronym>elements</acronym> which engage users. <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <dfn>CSS</dfn>, and <u>HTML</u> makes the total input and output of a fullstack
        website. Although <strong>JavaScript</strong> might sound hard it is pretty easy for <small>one</small> of the <kbd>most</kbd> important <i>Programming</i> <mark>languages</mark>. <small>One</small> of
        the main reasons for why <strong>JavaScript</strong> is so popular is because it is <small>one</small> of the only <cite>Programming</cite> <mark>languages</mark> that you could
        programm <q>Everywhere</q>. <small>One</small> of the main reasons for this is <strong>JavaScript</strong> <sup>runtime enviorment</sup> node.js. A <sup>runtime enviorment</sup> is
        the enviorment of which a <cite>Programming</cite> <mark>language</mark> is executed on such as <sub>visual studio code</sub> which I am executing on right 
        now. Node.js is a <sup>runtime enviorment</sup> where it is isolated to only provide and work for <strong>JavaScript</strong>. with everything it needs 
        to become <big>more</big> efficient. Well node.js also made <strong>JavaScript</strong> efficient not just inside the <samp>browser</samp> like almost every 
        <cite>Programming</cite> <mark>language</mark> but can make <strong>JavaScript</strong> run outside of the <samp>browser</samp> too. That gives users a choice; to either programm
        inside the <samp>browser</samp> or outside the <samp>browser</samp>. Also <strong>JavaScript</strong> has many tags which some are used in <dfn>CSS</dfn> and <ins>HTML</ins>. For example
        <kbd>most</kbd> basic and <kbd>most</kbd> used <acronym>element</acronym> is probably the .log <acronym>element</acronym> which is used to print or show the main code you want to 
        show. It is also always used first in <strong>JavaScript</strong> <i>Programming</i>. Therefore I belive <strong>JavaScript</strong> is <small>one</small> of the <kbd>most</kbd> important 
        <mark>languages</mark> of all time and is their for all <cite>Programming</cite> <mark></mark>languages!
        <blockquote>JavaScript is Amazing and is not as hard as you think!!!!!!!!!!!</blockquote>
        <b><big><center><span style="color:rgb(0, 204, 255)"><strong>JavaScript</strong> + <dfn>CSS</dfn> + <ins>HTML</ins> = The heart and the core of everything in a website</span></center></big></b>
        Code Example of JavaScript: <code><q>def sum(a,b): return a+b</q></code>
        <blockquote>This is another example of JavaScript spelled backward: <bdo dir='rtl'>JavaScript</bdo></blockquote>
        <code>document.write("<var>This is another example of JavaScript and some HTML</var>")</code>
