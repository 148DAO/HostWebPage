        <p>
            <strong>Python</strong> is a general-purpose programming language which means that it is a widely specalized in
            applications in application domains. <strong>Python</strong> could be used for many things though such as web development, 
            <u>AI</u>, Machine Learning, <em>Development</em> Applications, data anyalitics, Programming video games, and even design. 
            Although out of all, some stand out, such as analizing data, machine learning, and <u>AI</u>. Python is also known for 
            its simplicity. It is one of the simplest languages out their, with easy content, and simple key words. Some of them are
            print, else, if, and, input, format, int, float, an many others. <strong>Python</strong> is also one of the most used 
            platforms and is recommended by everyone. It is a very important language to learn for it is sometimes been called the
            most important language other than languages like Javascript. </br> <strong>Python</strong> is specialized in Machine 
            Learning because of its fluent, fast, and enables learners to process and <i>develop</i> algorithms quickly and 
            fluently so the learner still understands. Also it specalizes in data anyalitics and <u>AI</u> because it is so good
            a processing data. It is one of the top programing languages for <u>AI</u>. It has a standard library for development
            and some for <u>AI</u> which could be used for data analysis, which is how it gets its speciality in <u>AI</u>/Data 
            Analytics. Therefore I belive that <strong>Python</strong> is one of the best languages to <strike>learn</strike> be
            educated in and that itspecializes in may things!
            <center>Python = Fast, Fluent, Simple, important, and much more</center>
